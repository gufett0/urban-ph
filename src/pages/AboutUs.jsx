            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Urban Photo Hunts began in 2023 when a group of photography enthusiasts decided to formalize their weekend photo walks. 
              What started as casual meetups quickly grew into a community of photographers of all skill levels who share a passion for urban photography. 
              Today, we host dozens of events annually and have built a vibrant community of urban explorers and visual storytellers.
